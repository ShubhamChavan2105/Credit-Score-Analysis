# Credit-Score-Analysis
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to predict customer credit scores based on their financial and behavioral attributes. By leveraging machine learning models, this project automates credit score classification into categories (Good, Standard, Poor). This enables financial institutions to make informed lending decisions and enhance risk management strategies.


Overview
This project leverages machine learning to automate the prediction of customer credit scores, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that are often time-consuming and subjective. The dataset undergoes extensive preprocessing, including cleaning, imputation of missing values, and removal of outliers, to ensure data quality. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals key patterns and relationships among features, providing valuable insights into customer financial behavior.

The pipeline incorporates feature engineering, such as categorical encoding and numerical scaling, to enhance model performance. Various machine learning models, including Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost, are trained and evaluated. SMOTE is applied to address class imbalance, ensuring robust predictions across all credit score categories (Good, Standard, Poor). The project delivers reliable credit score classifications that can aid financial institutions in improving risk assessment and decision-making processes.


Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to automate and improve the credit scoring process. By utilizing clean and well-structured data, effective preprocessing, and robust algorithms, the model achieves reliable predictions of credit scores. The insights derived from EDA and the model's outputs provide a scalable framework that financial institutions can adopt for risk assessment and decision-making. Future improvements may include incorporating real-time data streams and optimizing models for deployment in production environments.
